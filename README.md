# Java URL Shortener

This project was developed during my **second year of B.Tech (ECE)** to explore the intersection of **Data Structures** and **Web Logic**.

### 🛠️ Why I built this:
* To implement a real-world application of **HashMaps** ($O(1)$ lookup).
* To understand **redirection logic** and unique ID generation algorithms.
* To practice **Interface-based design**, which I now recognize as a core part of the **Microservices** architecture used at Citi.

### 📈 Evolution:
While this started as a local Java project in my second year, I am now focused on scaling such logic using **Spring Boot** and **Cloud Foundry** as outlined in the Citi Analyst Program.
